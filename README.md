# Katas

This repository is a curated collection of programming katas and exercises gathered from various sources such as Codewars, ChatGPT, and other challenge platforms.

Each kata includes both the original statement (in English) and its Spanish translation, along with one or more solution approaches. The focus is on writing clean, efficient, and well-explained code â€” often exploring optimization and problem-solving patterns.

The repository is organized by source, making it easy to navigate between different platforms and track progress over time.
